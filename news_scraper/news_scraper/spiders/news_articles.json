In some cases, callers have said they enrolled in a plan that didn\u2019t allow them to see their providers. ", "She said people who are enrolling in Medicare Advantage should ask brokers or agents how doctors, prescriptions and services, including dental or vision care, are covered by the plans they are selling. Every state also offers counselors to help people navigate the enrollment process. ", "\u201cReally ask specific questions,\u201d Williams said. "]},
